# instagram_scraper
Instagram scraper using Selenium Webdriver

The following tasks are accomplished using the code:
-From the list of instagram handles obtained on searching ‘food’ in the search bar, we open the first 10 handles and find the top 5 which have the highest number of followers.
-Find the number of posts these handles have done in the previous 3 days.
-Depict this information using a suitable graph.
-Open the 5 handles we obtained, and scrape the content of the first 10 posts of each handle.
-Prepare a list of all words used in all the scraped posts and calculate the frequency of each word.
-Create a csv file with two columns : the word and its frequency.
-Find the hashtags that were most popular among these bloggers.
-Plot a Pie Chart of the top 5 hashtags obtained and the number of times they were used by these bloggers in the scraped posts.
-Find out the likes of the top 10 posts of the 5 handles obtained earlier.
-Calculate the average likes for a handle.
-Divide the average likes obtained from the number of followers of the handle to get the average followers:like ratio of each handle.
-Create a bar graph to depict the above obtained information.
